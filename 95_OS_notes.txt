* Low Level File/Stream Identification
	* File descriptor
		* A nonnegative integer that may refer to
			* regular files, pipes, FIFOs, sockets,
			terminals, or devices
		* each process has its own assigned set of file
		descriptors, has its own table
		* Used by the system to refer to files, not file
		names
			* The file name is converted to the file
			descriptor
		* When requrested, the lowest numbered unused file
		descriptor is assigned
* Standard file descriptors
	* When a process stars executing, it is generally given
	three standard file descriptors that are already open
		* This includes programs that are started by your
		shell
	* Standard in: input to the process, getchar() or scanf()
	* Standard out: default output from the process, puts() or
	printf()
	* Standard error: separate output for error information
	only. fputs() fprintf()
	* We can trick these into doing other things even though 
	they're made to think/act a certain way
* Sorry my notes suck I got no sleep last night so I'm struggle
hustling and I can't keep up with all of the code he's doing
