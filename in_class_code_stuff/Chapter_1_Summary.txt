Summary points taken from the end of the chapter, summarized in my own words.

* An operating system is software that manages hardware and gives
an environement for applications to run.
* Interrupts are a way that the hardware interacts with the
software. A signal is given to the CPU to let the OS know that an
event needs attention. Managed by the interruption handler.
* Main memory is the only large memory that can be accessed
directly by the processor, therefore programs must be in main 
memory for the computer to execute it.
* Main memory is volatile and loses information when power is
lost/turned off.
* Nonvolatile storage can hold a lot of data permanently - 
extension of main memory.
* The most common type of nonvolatile storage is a hard disk
that can store large amounts of programs and data.
* Sotrage systems can be organized by speed and cost.
Faster = more expensive.
* Modern computers have multiprocessor systems where each CPU has
several computing cores.
* Modern operating systems use multiprogramming systems where
several jobs will be in memory at once so the CPU always has 
something to do.
* An extension of multiprogramming is multitasking where the
CPU can switch processes to give the user a fast response time.
* The user mode and kernal mode exist to prevent user programs
from messing with OS functions.
* There are instructions such as I/O control, timer management,
etc. that can only be executed in kernal mode.
* The fundamental unit of work in an OS is the process. Process
management is creating/deleting processes and allowing them to 
communicate with each other.
* Memory is managed by keeping track of who is using what memory.
It also dynamically creates and frees memory space.
* The OS manages storage space.
* OS's provide security measures to protect itself and its users.
* Virtualization splits the hardware into several different
execution environments.
* Used data structures include ueues, stacks, lists, trees, and
maps.
* Computing happens in several different environments.
* Free and open source OS's are available for no-cost use,
redistribution, and modification.
